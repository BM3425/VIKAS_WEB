        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Vikas School, started by the YMCA Tiruvalla, Kerala, is dedicated to differently-abled (mentally and physically challenged) children. Initiated in 1989 with just 6 children and a solitary teacher, the school has grown significantly over the past 34 years, now serving 136 children and employing 16 staff members. The school caters to children from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds, most of whom come from families below the poverty line.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially housed in the YMCA premises with limited facilities, the school was relocated to Kaviyoor in 2014. This move was advised and initiated by the late Mar Chrysostom Mar Thoma Valiya Metropolitan, who served as the school's patron for many years. The new campus at Elavinal, Kaviyoor, owned and run by the YMCA Public Charitable Trust of YMCA Tiruvalla, was developed with the generous support of well-wishers and the general public.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite limited means, the community raised Rs. 2.5 Crore to purchase and develop a 1.43-acre campus and construct a 24,000 sq. ft. building, comprising office and classrooms for the school. This initiative has allowed the YMCA to provide a state-of-the-art learning environment for differently-abled children, for which it remains indebted forever.

        <h2>Sponsor A Differently Abled Child Project</h2>
        <p>
          As the school’s expenses increase yearly, we are unable to charge fees due to the financial constraints of the students' families. We rely on the support of like-minded individuals to raise the necessary funds to sustain and run the school. We welcome your participation in this noble venture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your support can make a significant difference. Join us in the "Sponsor a Child Project" and help us fulfill our solemn responsibility to our community. Let us remember the words of our Lord, “In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”
